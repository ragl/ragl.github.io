My Future About.Me
I'm trying to make a simple about me page with the services I can offer - I use the template "SHIELD - Free Bootstrap 3 Theme" from Carlos Alvarez

I would like to have in in german and english - and due to my rusty coding skills know that it is possible - but just not how it is done smart.

any tips?

Thnks
